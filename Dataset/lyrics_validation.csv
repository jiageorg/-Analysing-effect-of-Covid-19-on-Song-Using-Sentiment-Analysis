"Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out Get some air now, let yo edge out Too soon, I spoke You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out? I need rest now, got me bummed out You so, you so, you Baby, baby, babe I've been on my empty mind shit I try to keep from losin' the rest of me I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in Good days, good days, always Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations I disappear if you let me Feelin' like, yeah (On your own) Feelin' like Jericho Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood Know you like that shit Can't groove it, ba-baby Heavy on my empty mind shit I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me) Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe You don't care Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent) Tryna make sense of loose change Got me a war in my mind (My mind) Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile Still wanna try, still believe in Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind) Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind) Good day living in my mind Gotta get right Tryna free my mind before the end of the world I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text I choose not to respond I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na) Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind You've been making me feel like I'm Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind",negative,,,
"I got my driver's license last week Just like we always talked about 'Cause you were so excited for me To finally drive up to your house But today I drove through the suburbs Crying 'cause you weren't around And you're probably with that blonde girl Who always made me doubt She's so much older than me She's everything I'm insecure about Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street And all my friends are tired Of hearing how much I miss you but I kinda feel sorry for them 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs And pictured I was driving home to you And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street Red lights Stop signs I still see your face In the white cars Front yards Can't drive past the places We used to Go to 'Cause I still fucking love you, babe Sidewalks We crossed I still hear your voice In the traffic We're laughing Over all the noise God, I'm so blue Know we're through But I still fucking love you, babe I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street",negative,,,
"Ooh Na-na, yeah I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh) You look so happy when I'm not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away You could've asked me why I broke your heart You could've told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasn't there And just pretended like you didn't care I don't know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day (So) I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you won't love me for a second time I don't know why I run away, oh, girl Said, I make you cry when I run away Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that I'm much too late And you deserve someone better Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah) Save your tears for another day (Yeah) I don't know why I run away I'll make you cry when I run away Save your tears for another day Ooh, girl, I said (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah)",negative,,,
"I can't seem to focus And you don't seem to notice I'm not here I'm just a mirror You check your complexion To find your reflection's all alone I had to go Can't you hear me?

"Everybody knows my name now But something 'bout it still feels strange Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself And seeing somebody else And everything is not the same now It feels like all our lives have changed Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down But it's killing me now What if you had it all But nobody to call? Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just fucking lonely I'm so lo-o-o-onely Lo-o-o-onely Everybody knows my past now Like my house was always made of glass And maybe that's the price you pay For the money and fame at an early age And everybody saw me sick And it felt like no one gave a shit They criticized the things I did As an idiot kid What if you had it all But nobody to call? Maybe then you'd know me 'Cause I've had everything But no one's listening And that's just fucking lonely I'm so lo-o-o-onely Lo-o-o-onely I'm so lo-o-o-onely Lo-o-o-onely",negative,,,
